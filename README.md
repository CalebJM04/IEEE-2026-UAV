  *PCB Stackup

  This board was custom-designed by me. It features two linear regulators to power an RFM9x feather (which this PCB will support as the main microcontroller), a barometer for accurate altitude data,
and pinouts for ESC PWM support, as well as pinouts for a Pixy2 camera for image recognition.
